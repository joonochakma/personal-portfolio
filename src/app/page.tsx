      Hey. Im
      <Navbar />
      I'm a passionate software developer based in Melbourne, Australia.
      Currently, I am honing my skills and expanding my knowledge at Swinburne
      University of Technology. My journey into the world of software
      development is fueled by a deep curiosity and a love for technology. When
      I'm not coding, you can find me capturing moments through photography or
      creating melodies with my music. Welcome to my portfolio, where I showcase
      my projects and the creative solutions I've developed along the way.
