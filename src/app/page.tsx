        I'm a passionate software developer based in Melbourne, Australia.
        Currently, I am honing my skills and expanding my knowledge at Swinburne
        University of Technology. My journey into the world of software
        development is fueled by a deep curiosity and a love for technology.
        When I'm not coding, you can find me capturing moments through
        photography or creating melodies with my music. Welcome to my portfolio,
        where I showcase my projects and the creative solutions I've developed
        along the way.
